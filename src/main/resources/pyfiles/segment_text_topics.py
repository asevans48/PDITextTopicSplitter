"""
Splits text into individual segments based on discovered topics. Uses the command
line to retrieve segments. Segments are output in a json object. Should attempt
to limit the text to be segemented to avoid overly large output. Designed
for use in Pentaho. Pentaho can be used to control threading and other basics.
